Songs of Fineract
=================

In code we gather, lines entwined,
for banks of hope the world designed;
a river of ledgers, open and clear,
that carries the dreams of those held dear.

From ports where Docker engines hum,
to clouds where jar-born servers run,
we raise a boot, the service sings—
Spring’s warm heart with sturdy wings.

Tenants whisper in UTC,
where time is kept in constancy;
Hikari pools the patient light,
database currents swift and tight.

If passwords bloom in env’s embrace,
if secrets never show their face,
then routes through SSL are cast—
a silver thread, secure and fast.

We build with Gradle’s steady beat,
clean, then test, then jar complete;
compose the stack, let bridges start,
Maria’s tide, Postgres’ art.

In swaggered fields the APIs
unfurl like maps in azure skies;
clients wander, mobile, web,
brushing endpoints, flow by ebb.

Logs speak softly, only when
errors call to page-bound pen;
info’s scarce, and debug knows
the trace of thorn beneath the rose.

Contributors, come, take your part:
open a JIRA, sketch the chart;
rebase gently, keep it small,
let tidy commits be your call.

Spotless combs the tangled mane,
Checkstyle keeps the carriage plain;
Jacoco counts the steps we tread,
coverage lanterns glow ahead.

In clusters green or local loam,
with helm or kube we pitch a home;
minikube echoes, pods align—
a constellation, service spine.

If tests grow fickle in the night,
name the flake and mark it right;
raise the issue, prune the vine—
merit lives in discipline.

License feathers, Apache’s wing,
permits the code to dance and sing;
NOTICE murmurs, sources tell
how borrowed stones were fit so well.

Fineract’s vow, both calm and bright:
bring hidden ledgers into light—
for those unbanked, whose futures wait,
we open doors and counters gate.

So clone the song, and run the rhyme,
let branches merge with careful time;
wherever balances need a friend,
this open river has no end.
